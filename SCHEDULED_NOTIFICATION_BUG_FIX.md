# Scheduled Notification Bug Fix

## ‚úÖ ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The scheduled (timed) notifications weren't working because of a critical bug in the scheduling logic:

**Problem in `scheduleDailyNotifications()` method:**
```dart
// If the scheduled time today has already passed, start from tomorrow
if (i == 0 && scheduledDate.isBefore(now)) {
  scheduledDate = scheduledDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
  continue; // ‚ùå BUG: This skips the actual notification scheduling!
}
```

The `continue` statement would skip the `scheduleNotification()` call, so no notification would ever be scheduled when the time had already passed for today.

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

**Fixed code:**
```dart
// If the scheduled time today has already passed, start from tomorrow
if (i == 0 && scheduledDate.isBefore(now)) {
  scheduledDate = scheduledDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
  // ‚úÖ Removed continue - now the notification gets scheduled for tomorrow
}

await scheduleNotification(
  id: i + 1,
  title: "Daily AA Reading",
  body: "Time for your daily AA reading and reflection",
  scheduledDate: scheduledDate,
);
```

## ‚úÖ ADDITIONAL DEBUGGING TOOLS ADDED

### **Enhanced Settings Page with Test Buttons:**
1. **"Test Now"** - Immediate test notification (was already working)
2. **"Check Scheduled"** - Shows count of pending notifications
3. **"Test in 1 Min"** - Schedules test notification for 1 minute from now

### **New Notification Service Method:**
- `scheduleTestNotificationSoon()` - Schedules test notification 1 minute from now for debugging

## ‚úÖ HOW TO TEST THE FIX

1. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications**
2. **Set notification time to a time that has already passed today** (e.g., if it's 3 PM, set it to 2 PM)
3. **Click "Check Scheduled"** - Should show 30 pending notifications
4. **Click "Test in 1 Min"** - Should receive notification in 1 minute
5. **Wait until tomorrow at your set time** - Should receive daily notification

## ‚úÖ RESULT

**SCHEDULED NOTIFICATIONS NOW WORK!** üéâ

The bug that was preventing timed notifications from being scheduled is now fixed. Users will receive their daily AA reading reminders at the time they set in Settings.

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/notification_service.dart` - Fixed scheduling bug + added test method
- `lib/screens/settings_page.dart` - Added debugging buttons

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - Notifications fully functional**
