# 🌟 App Rating System Guide

## Overview
Your AA Readings app has a comprehensive rating system that behaves differently in debug vs production builds.

## 🔧 Debug Mode (Development)
**When you run:** `flutter run` or debug from VS Code

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Rating logic works (tracking dismissals, timing, etc.)
- ✅ All UI elements appear correctly
- ❌ In-app review completes silently (no rating dialog)
- ❌ Store links may not open actual Play Store
- 📝 Perfect for testing without interrupting development

## 🚀 Production Mode (Release)
**When you build:** `flutter build apk --release`

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Native Android rating dialog appears
- ✅ Users can rate 1-5 stars directly in app
- ✅ Store links open Google Play Store
- ✅ Real rating submissions to Google Play
- 🎯 Actual user experience

## 📱 How to Test Production Rating

### 1. Build Release APK
```bash
# Run the build script
build_release.bat

# Or manually:
flutter build apk --release
flutter install
```

### 2. Test Rating Flows
1. Open the app on your device
2. Navigate: **Menu → About → Rating System Demo**
3. Try these actions:
   - **"Test In-App Review"** - Shows native rating dialog
   - **"Test Direct Store Opening"** - Opens Google Play Store
   - **"Simulate Dismiss"** - Test dismiss logic
   - **"Reset State"** - Clear rating preferences

### 3. Expected Production Behavior

**In-App Review (Preferred):**
- Native Android dialog appears
- User rates 1-5 stars
- Review can be submitted directly
- No app store navigation needed

**Direct Store Opening (Fallback):**
- Google Play Store opens
- Your app's listing page
- User can leave detailed review

## 🎯 Rating Banner Logic

The rating banner appears automatically based on:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **First time** | Shows after normal app usage |
| **Dismissed 1-2 times** | Shows again after 7 days |
| **Dismissed 3+ times** | Hidden permanently |
| **Already rated** | Never shows again |

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

**Rating Demo Screen** (only visible in debug mode):
- Access via About page → Development Tools
- View current rating state
- Test all rating scenarios
- Monitor behavior logs
- Reset state for testing

**Debug Reset** (only in debug mode):
- "Reset" button in rating banner
- Clears all rating preferences
- Useful for repeated testing

## 📊 Analytics Integration

The rating system integrates with your consent management:
- Tracks rating interactions (if analytics consented)
- Monitors success/failure rates
- Respects user privacy preferences

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** In-app review doesn't work in debug
**Solution:** This is normal - test with release build

**Problem:** Store doesn't open in debug
**Solution:** Expected behavior - works in production

**Problem:** Rating dialog not appearing
