# Voice Testing in Onboarding - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE ADDED
Added voice testing/preview functionality to the onboarding voice selection step, allowing users to hear their selected voice before proceeding.

## âœ… CHANGES MADE

### 1. Added TTS Capability to Onboarding
**File**: `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`

**Added**:
- `flutter_tts` import for TTS functionality
- `FlutterTts _testTts` instance for voice testing
- `bool _isTestingVoice` state to track testing status
- `dispose()` method to properly clean up TTS instance

### 2. Voice Testing Method
**Method**: `_testSelectedVoice()`

**Functionality**:
- Maps user selection to appropriate voice configuration
- Configures TTS with selected voice (name, locale)
- Speaks a personalized test message
- Handles errors gracefully with user feedback
- Prevents multiple simultaneous tests
- Auto-resets testing state after 3 seconds

### 3. Voice Testing UI
**Location**: Voice Selection step (step 5) in onboarding

**Features**:
- **Test Button**: "Test This Voice" with play icon
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner and "Testing Voice..." when active
- **Visual Feedback**: Button disabled during testing
- **Responsive Design**: Centered, prominent button styling
- **Color Scheme**: Matches onboarding indigo theme

## ðŸŽ¨ USER EXPERIENCE

### Voice Testing Flow:
1. User selects accent (US/UK) and gender (Male/Female)
2. Selection summary shows: "Selected: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA Female Voice"
3. User taps "Test This Voice" button
4. Button shows loading state: "Testing Voice..."
5. TTS speaks: "Hello! This is your selected USA Female Voice. I will be reading your daily AA readings and prayers."
6. Button re-enables after 3 seconds

### Test Messages by Selection:
- **USA Male**: "Hello! This is your selected USA Male Voice..."
- **USA Female**: "Hello! This is your selected USA Female Voice..." (DEFAULT)
- **UK Male**: "Hello! This is your selected UK Male Voice..."
- **UK Female**: "Hello! This is your selected UK Female Voice..."

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Voice Configuration Mapping:
```dart
// User Selection â†’ Voice Name â†’ Locale â†’ Test Message
'US' + 'Male'   â†’ 'en-us-x-iol-local' â†’ 'en-US' â†’ "USA Male Voice"
'US' + 'Female' â†’ 'en-us-x-tpc-local' â†’ 'en-US' â†’ "USA Female Voice" (DEFAULT)
'UK' + 'Male'   â†’ 'en-gb-x-gbb-network' â†’ 'en-GB' â†’ "UK Male Voice"
'UK' + 'Female' â†’ 'en-gb-x-gba-local' â†’ 'en-GB' â†’ "UK Female Voice"
```

### Error Handling:
- **TTS Failures**: Shows orange SnackBar with error message
- **Multiple Clicks**: Button disabled during testing
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup on disposal
- **Async Safety**: Checks `mounted` before setState

### UI States:
- **Default**: "Test This Voice" with play icon

3. **Check voice availability** on various Android versions
4. **Test error scenarios** (no network, no TTS engine)
5. **Validate integration** with Voice Settings screen
