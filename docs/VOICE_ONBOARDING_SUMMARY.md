# Voice Preference Onboarding - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
Added voice preference selection to the onboarding flow that allows users to choose their preferred voice accent (US/UK) and gender (Male/Female), with Female set as the default.

## âœ… CHANGES MADE

### 1. Updated Onboarding Screen Structure
**File**: `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`

**Added**:
- New step 5: "Voice Settings" between Background Access and Privacy steps
- Voice preference variables: `selectedVoiceRegion` (default: 'US') and `selectedVoiceGender` (default: 'Female')
- Interactive voice selection UI with flag emojis and gender icons

### 2. Voice Selection UI Components
- **Accent Selection**: US ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ options with visual selection indicators
- **Gender Selection**: Male and Female options with appropriate icons
- **Live Preview**: Shows selected combination (e.g., "Selected: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA Female Voice")
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected options highlighted with indigo color scheme

### 3. Voice Preference Logic
**Method**: `_saveVoicePreferences()`
- Maps user selection to voice system preferences
- Sets appropriate default voices:
  - US Male: `en-us-x-iol-local`
  - US Female: `en-us-x-tpc-local` (DEFAULT)
  - UK Male: `en-gb-x-gbb-network`
  - UK Female: `en-gb-x-gba-local`
- Saves both the technical preference and user-friendly selection

### 4. Integration with Existing Voice System
- Seamlessly integrates with existing `voice_selection_screen_new.dart`
- Uses the same voice preference keys and default voice mappings
- User can still change voices later in Voice Settings

## ðŸŽ¨ USER EXPERIENCE

### Onboarding Flow:
1. **Welcome** â†’ 2. **Notifications** â†’ 3. **Alarms** â†’ 4. **Background** â†’ 5. **Voice Settings** â†’ 6. **Privacy**

### Voice Selection Step:

// User Selection â†’ Voice Preference Key â†’ Default Voice
'US' + 'Female' â†’ 'us_female_voice' â†’ 'en-us-x-tpc-local'

'UK' + 'Male'   â†’ 'uk_male_voice'   â†’ 'en-gb-x-gbb-network'
```

### Storage:

- Consistent with existing voice preference system

### Step Numbers Updated:

## ðŸ“± NEXT STEPS

1. Test the onboarding flow with the new voice step
2. Verify integration with existing voice system
3. Test TTS functionality with different voice selections
4. Consider adding voice preview/test button in onboarding (future enhancement)
