    "title": "The Just for Today Card",
    "content": " Just for today, I will focus on living through this day only and not tackle my entire life's problems at once, knowing I can handle anything for twelve hours that might seem overwhelming for a lifetime. I will choose happiness, recognizing that most people are as happy as they decide to be. I will adjust myself to life as it is rather than trying to mold everything to my own desires, taking things as they come and adapting accordingly. I will strive to strengthen my mind by studying, learning something useful, and engaging in reading that requires effort and concentration. I will exercise my soul by doing a good deed without seeking recognition, doing things I might not want to for the sake of growth, and keeping my hurt feelings to myself. I will aim to be agreeable by presenting myself well, speaking gently, acting courteously, refraining from criticism, and focusing only on improving myself. I will create a daily program to avoid the pitfalls of hurry and indecision, even if I don't follow it exactly. I will take a quiet half-hour to relax and gain perspective on my life. Lastly, I will be unafraid—embracing beauty and believing that as I give to the world, the world will give back to me",

Where there is hatred, let me bring love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is error, truth; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, help me to seek not so much to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, and to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive, in pardoning that we are pardoned, and in dying that we are born to eternal life.",

  {
    "title": "Acceptance is the Answer",
    "content": "And acceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation – some facet of my life – unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.",
