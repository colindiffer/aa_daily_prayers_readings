        " Just for today, I will focus on living through this day only and not tackle my entire life's problems at once, knowing I can handle anything for twelve hours that might seem overwhelming for a lifetime. I will choose happiness, recognizing that most people are as happy as they decide to be. I will adjust myself to life as it is rather than trying to mold everything to my own desires, taking things as they come and adapting accordingly. I will strive to strengthen my mind by studying, learning something useful, and engaging in reading that requires effort and concentration. I will exercise my soul by doing a good deed without seeking recognition, doing things I might not want to for the sake of growth, and keeping my hurt feelings to myself. I will aim to be agreeable by presenting myself well, speaking gently, acting courteously, refraining from criticism, and focusing only on improving myself. I will create a daily program to avoid the pitfalls of hurry and indecision, even if I don't follow it exactly. I will take a quiet half-hour to relax and gain perspective on my life. Lastly, I will be unafraid—embracing beauty and believing that as I give to the world, the world will give back to me",

When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation – some facet of my life – unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God’s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.",
