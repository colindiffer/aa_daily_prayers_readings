# SYNTAX ERROR FIX - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Flutter compilation error in `reading_list_view.dart` at line 37
```
Error: Can't find '}' to match '{'.
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
                                  ^
```

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Brace count analysis**: File had 53 opening braces `{` but only 52 closing braces `}`
- **Missing closing brace**: The file was missing one closing brace at the end of the `_buildAnimatedPlayingIndicator()` method

## Fix Applied
**Before**: 
```dart
      );
    }
}
```

**After**: 
```dart
      );
    }
  }  // ‚Üê Added missing closing brace for method
}
```

## Verification
- **Opening braces**: 53 ‚úÖ
- **Closing braces**: 53 ‚úÖ
- **Brace balance**: MATCHED ‚úÖ

## Files Fixed
- `c:\Users\ColinDiffer\app\aa_readings_25\lib\widgets\reading_list_view.dart`
